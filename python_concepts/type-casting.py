"""Type-casting in python is used to convert the data-type of a data to another data-type

for example -
suppose we have 
a = 5
b = '5'
here 5 is a interger type and '5' is a string type. Now if we go to perform certain operation
like adding one integer ane string or concateniting a integer and string it will throw an eror
To perform addition we first need to convert the string to int by using type casting or
to perform concatenation we need to convert the integer to string
Lets see the example in action
"""

# a = 5
# b = '5'
# c = str(a)+b
# print(c)

# a = 5
# b = '5'
# c = a+int(b)
# print(c)
