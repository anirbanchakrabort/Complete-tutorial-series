""EC2 - EC2 is the elastic compute cloud which is used to run the vertual mahine over the internet
We habe to select the AMI whcih is used to run the instance and contains EBS snapshot,permission 
and configuration. The security group act as a firewall for EC2 and it controls the flow of 
inbound and outbound traffic. It is statefull ie it provide only allow rule and deny implicitly.

Type of instance:-

General purpose 

compute optimized

memory optimized

storage optimized

HPC(Hight power computing) optimized

Accelerated computing

EC2 pricing model:-

on-demnd instance- standard rate , un-predictable workloads , cannot be interrepted and no discount.

Spot instance - upto 75% discount on used capacity , predictable workloads and can be interrepted

Reserved instance - 1 or 3 year of commitment , un-predictable workloads and can be interrepted

AWS Region and Availibility zone

Region:-

> Region are the data center
> A region consists of one or more Availibility zone
> Each region is completly isolated from another region in AWS

Availibility zone:-

> An Availibility zone spans over one or more data center
>Each Availibility zone is isocated form other Az in AWS
>A Availibility zone is designed for individual failure zone.

Ip address - 

> Private ip
Private ip are attached to the EC2 instance whenever we create a instance.Private ip's can 
be retained even if the instances are powerd-off. It cannot be moved between the instances

> public ip
public ip are dynamic ip that are attached to an instance whenever we create an instance.The
public ip gets lost if an instance is powerd-off. It cannot be moved between the instances.

> Elastic ip
Elastic ip are static ip which can be attached to an instance . Elastic ip can be retained
even if the instances are powerd-off.It can be moved between instances. If the elastic ip are
not used than it can be chargable.
