""Vpc is the virtual private cloud which is used to create virtual network onto the cloud.Each
vpc is isolately separeted from other virtual network in aws. While creating a vpc we need 
tospecify the renage of ipv4 addresses from the vpc in the form of classless inter-domain routing
(cidr) block .A user can create 5 vpc per region. We also need to specify the subnet range which
is one of the component of vpc.
A subnet is the range of ip addresses. There are two types of subnet

> private subnet - private subnet doesnot have route to the internet gateway
>public subnet - public subnet hava a route to the internet gateway

By deafult a vpc canot directly connect with other services in AWS , so after creating a vpc
we need to attach it to the internet gateway in order to communicate

Nat-gateway - A nat gateway is a component of vpc with which a private subnet can commnicate with
internet internally . No external services can communicate with the internal service.

NACL- is the network access control list is the firewll for subnet and is stateless ie it provide
both allow and deny rules.
