""IAM is the Identity and Access Management which is used to control the access to the Aws
services. With IAM we can create user , group , create permission and assign policies and
create role.

user - user are the individual account in which we loged in

group - group are used to create permission and policies to one or more user

role - roles are the used to deligate permission to the user

policies are assigned to the user so that the user can use those specific services

IAM best practices

Lock your AWS account

grant list privillages to the user

delete the unused permissions

use group to assign policy to the user

use MFA over the password for extra security of your aws account
