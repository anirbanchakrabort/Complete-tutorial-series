""Jenkins is a open-source automation tool written in java and build-in plugins for continuous
intregation purpose. With jenkins the developer can intregate the changes.

To create a pipeline in jenkins we need to perform some steps:-

First we need to install the github plugins by going to the manage plugin section in the 
jenkins gui and then we need to click on the new item and select the freestyle project

After selecting the freestyle project under the source code management tab we need to select
the git and provide our github repository link and click ok

Then will click on build now and in the output section we can view that the entire github repository
has been copied to the jenkins workspace that can be view in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace

If we want to intregate maven with jenkins then we nned to first setup the enviornment variable
like JAVA_HOME,M2,M2_HOME in the bash profile and then in the global configuration tool seeting 
in the jenkins gui we need to provide the java and maven path and then we need to go to the 
new item and select the maven project and provide our github repository link. We will see
that it will create the artifact which can be view in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace under target folder

if we want to create CI/CD pipeline for java application we can intregate quality check like
sonar cubes which will provide extra code coverages . we can also intregate security scans like
vera code as well.

In the microservice enviornment we can have seperate pipeline for each microservices by implementing
above steps for the CI.

Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a 
Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control.
