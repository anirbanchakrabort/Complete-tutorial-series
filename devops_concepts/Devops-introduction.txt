"""Devops - Devops is a software development practice which involves continuous intregation,
continuous deployment , continuous testing , continuous delivery and continuous monitoring

Devops was introduced to bridge the gape between the developer and operation team. intregation
earlier days before devops was introduced the developer after writing the code sends the code
to the operation team and if there was any error or bugs in the code than the operation team
finds it difficut to fixed the error and the code fails to run in operation machine.This creates
a conflict between the devops and opps team.



CI/CD pipeline

CD/CD  is the devops approach in which at first the developer makes chnages to the code and then
makes a commit and pushed the code to the central repository ie github. After the code has between
pushed to the github the jenkin server which is the continuous intregation tool pulls the 
code and starts the build. In continuous intregation the code is compiled and build with the 
help of maven which is integreted with jenkins and after the build is sucess meaven generates after
artifact which is stored in the jenkins workspace under /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/target
and this artifacts are then pushed to the continuous testing where unit testing and continuous testing
happens with the automated testing tools like selenium. After the code hasbeen successfully
tested it is pushed to the staging enviornment where final check is done and finally it is 
deployed to the production server with continuous delivery for final release and after the 
code has been deployed to the productuon server then the continuous monitorng happen with the tools
like nagos and visualization tools like grafana.There is a feadback loop which send the code if 
there is any error and the developer is constantly notified about the entire process

CI/CD pipeline using Devops and AWS

Codecommit (central repository system) 

Codebuild - (build tool continuous integration) where code is being compiled , tested and ready for release for the production

buildspec.yml - contain build command used by codebuild to run the build

artifact - output file for codebuild which is stored in the s3 for retention if the docker container get deleted after successfull build 

Codedeploy - Codedeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployment to Amazon Ec2 , serverless service like Lambda , Amazon ECS .

CodeDeploy can deploy application content that runs on a server and is stored in Amazon S3 buckets

CodePipeline - automates the entire process from codecommit to codedeploy
